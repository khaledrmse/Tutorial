Java Generic methods and generic classes enable programmers to specify, with a single method declaration, a set of related methods, 
or with a single class declaration, a set of related types, respectively.

Generics also provide compile-time type safety that allows programmers to catch invalid types at compile time.

Using Java Generic concept, we might write a generic method for sorting an array of objects,
 then invoke the generic method with Integer arrays, Double arrays, String arrays and so on, to sort the array elements.
