each run of the test it will be initialeze the method at every execution
test method don't have a specific order
@BeforeAll: executed before all test method
@BeforeEach: executed before each method
@AfterAll: executed after all methods test
@AfterEeach: executed after each method


beforeAll will be executed before the instance of the test class ;

so ther method should be static

test instance make your junit test class behave differently 
option : Per method: instance is created for each method 
		 Per class  : create instance for class
		 
	when we use TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS is not required to add static key word to beforeAll
